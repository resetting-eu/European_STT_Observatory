I am extracting content from catalogs of Smart Tourism solutions. Each solution has a name, a producer, a description and a solution type. However, some catalogs have the same solution but with slightly different names and with different solution types, but they mean the same. So I want your help to identify repetitions among the catalogs by giving to you the solutions names, descriptions, producers and types in json format. A solution can have more than one solution type. The keys are: solution name - 'title'; solution description - 'product_description'; producer - 'company'; solution type(s) - 'solType'.
Solution 1 - ```SOLUTION 1 ´´´
Solution 2 - ```SOLUTION 2 ´´´
Finally, just to clarify that I don't want you to give me code to identify these possible repetitions. I want you to use your reasoning skills to tell me if they are the same solution or not. To do this, I just want to get back a JSON obejct with the key "repetition" and with two possible values "YES" ({"repetition": "YES"}) or "NO" ({"repetition": "NO"}).

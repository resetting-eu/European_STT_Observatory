<p style="text-align: left;">STTs primarily for reservation services or direct marketing (i.e., sending promotional messages to potential customers). They are divided into three types:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li><strong>Pre-Consumption: </strong>STTs aid in reservation services or direct marketing for tourists not yet engaged in activities. (e.g., choosing and booking the destination and related tourist activities.).</li>
    <li><strong>Consumption: </strong>STTs for direct marketing and used during the consumption stage, when are tourists enjoying touristic activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Consumption: </strong>STTs used after the touristic activities, where tourists act as influencers or further users (e.g., sharing feelings raised and/or contents created during the touristâ€™s activity).</li>
</ul>

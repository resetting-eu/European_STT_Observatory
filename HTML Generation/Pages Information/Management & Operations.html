<p>These STTs assist in various aspects of the tourism offer and are used by the tourist operators. Not by tourists. They fall into four types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Design of Tourism Products: <span>&nbsp;</span></strong>STTs that help create the touristic offer (e.g., B2B tools for creating tour packages).</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment of Tourism Products: <span>&nbsp;</span></strong>STTs, such as booking or payment platforms, that enable direct acquisition of tourism activities. They enable tourists to secure their participation in the tourism activities. However, tools that redirect to these services, or enhance or manage the experience are not included.</li>
    <li><strong>Operation of Tourism Products: <span>&nbsp;</span></strong>STTs that help assisting in the actual functioning or management of the touristic offerings once the customer is engaged with them (e.g., Crowd Management Tools).</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance/Evolution of Tourism Products: <span>&nbsp;</span></strong>STTs that help evaluate and make decisions regarding the existing touristic offer (e.g., Data Analytics Tools).</li>
</ul>
